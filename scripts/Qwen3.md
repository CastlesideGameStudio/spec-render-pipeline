### üé® Image Generation Capabilities

#### ‚úÖ 1. Native Image Generation

* Capable of generating images directly from prompts without requiring external models.
* Leverages a multimodal architecture for richer visual grounding.

#### ‚úÖ 2. Style Versatility

Supports a wide range of artistic styles:

* Photorealistic
* Disney-style
* Cartoon
* Watercolor / Hand-painted
* Anime
* 3D Render
* Pixel Art
* World of Warcraft-style (dark fantasy, stylized realism)
* Studio Ghibli-style (soft palettes, whimsical detail)
* Line art / Ink sketch

**Prompt Examples:**

* ‚ÄúA medieval blacksmith in a Disney-style animation‚Äù
* ‚ÄúA realistic portrait of a medieval blacksmith at work‚Äù
* ‚ÄúA cartoon medieval blacksmith in a blacksmith shop‚Äù
* ‚ÄúA medieval blacksmith in World of Warcraft style with exaggerated armor‚Äù
* ‚ÄúA Studio Ghibli-style medieval blacksmith in soft pastel tones‚Äù
* ‚ÄúA medieval blacksmith rendered as a pixel art character‚Äù

#### ‚úÖ 3. View-Specific Generation

Handles orthographic views for consistent model turnarounds:

* Orthographic front view
* Orthographic side view
* Orthographic back view

Supports chaining of views with consistent subject attributes by:

* Repeating subject descriptors exactly in each prompt
* Referencing ‚Äúsame subject‚Äù or ‚Äúsame character as previous image‚Äù when chaining

#### ‚úÖ 4. Format Control

Widescreen and layout directives are recognized:

* ‚Äúwidescreen format‚Äù
* ‚Äúcinematic aspect ratio‚Äù
* ‚Äúcentered composition‚Äù
* **New Requirement**: Supports transparent or solid-color backgrounds to match character sheets like the example image (no detailed background elements).

#### ‚úÖ 5. Prompt Engineering & Instructions

* Supports structured natural language prompting
* Known internal commands: `/think`, `/no_think` for logical depth control
* Instruction-following is strong
* Style, perspective, lighting, and composition can be included in a single structured prompt

**Example:**

> ‚ÄúA medieval blacksmith with a long beard, orthographic front view, in a Disney animation style, widescreen format, soft ambient lighting, 3/4 body view, isolated on blank background.‚Äù

#### ‚úÖ 6. Subject Consistency Across Variants

While Qwen 3 does not natively offer inpainting or reference image input, it maintains subject consistency across:

* Front/side/back views
* Different styles of the same subject
* Scenes involving same-character rendering when described identically

Best practice:

* Use strict, repeated descriptors (e.g., ‚Äúa blacksmith with a red apron and gray beard‚Äù)
* Use chained prompt sequences when generating variations

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Deployment Overview

#### ‚úÖ RunPod Compatibility

* Available via community-built templates
* Supports deployment with Ollama and vLLM backends
* GPU recommendation: 24GB VRAM or higher (e.g., A100, A40)

#### ‚úÖ Prompt-Only Control

* No GUI required
* Can be fully operated via API or text-based CLI interaction

#### ‚úÖ Output Formats

* Images can be exported in standard formats (PNG, JPEG)
* Metadata can include prompt trace
* Transparent or solid-color backgrounds achievable via prompt instruction

#### ‚úÖ Extensibility

* Compatible with external tools for:

  * Batch generation
  * Web UI front-ends
  * Cloud deployment (e.g., Linode, AWS, GCS)

---

### üîê Prompt Safeguards and Limitations

* Does not support Stable Diffusion-style prompt weighting syntax (`::`, `--no`)
* Negative prompting must be done via natural phrasing (e.g., ‚Äúwithout helmet‚Äù)
* Style is inferred more than enforced ‚Äî multiple generations recommended for stylistic accuracy

---

### üßæ Summary

Qwen 3 is a robust multimodal model highly suitable for detailed, stylistically diverse image generation, including multi-angle orthographic visualizations. It supports widescreen layout and prompt-only control, including background-less images suitable for design and animation workflows. It is deployable on RunPod and extensible into cloud workflows including GitHub Actions and object storage.

**Next Step**: Build tutorial for full pipeline:

* GitHub Actions image-gen trigger
* RunPod API job execution
* Linode S3-compatible object storage for generated output
