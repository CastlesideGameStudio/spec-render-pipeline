RUN AN OLLAMA SERVER ON A RUNPOD CPU
====================================

In this guide, you will learn how to run an Ollama server on your RunPod CPU for inference. Although this tutorial focuses on CPU compute, you can also select a GPU type and follow the same steps. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a fully functioning Ollama server ready to handle requests.

Setting up your Endpoint
------------------------

**note**  
Use a Network volume to attach to your Worker so that it can cache the LLM and decrease cold start times. If you do not use a network volume, the Worker will have to download the model every time it spins back up, leading to increased latency and resource consumption.

1. Log in to your RunPod account.  
2. Navigate to the **Serverless** section and select **New Endpoint**.  
3. Choose **CPU** and provide a name for your Endpoint (for example, `8 vCPUs 16 GB RAM`).  
4. Configure your Worker settings according to your needs.  
5. In the **Container Image** field, enter:
   ```
   pooyaharatian/runpod-ollama:0.0.8
   ```
6. In the **Container Start Command** field, specify the Ollama-supported model (e.g. `orca-mini` or `llama3.1`).  
7. Allocate sufficient container disk space for your model (typically 20 GB).  
8. *(Optional)* In Environment Variables, set `OLLAMA_MODELS` to `/runpod-volume` to store the model on your attached volume.  
9. Click **Deploy** to initiate the setup.

Once the Worker is ready and your model is downloaded, proceed to send a test request.

Sending a Run request
---------------------

1. Go to the **Requests** section in the RunPod web UI.  
2. In the input module, enter the following JSON:

   ```json
   {
     "input": {
       "method_name": "generate",
       "input": {
         "prompt": "why the sky is blue?"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Select **Run** to execute the request.  
4. Wait a few seconds for a response, which should look like:

   ```json
   {
     "delayTime": 153,
     "executionTime": 4343,
     "id": "c2cb6af5-c822-4950-bca9-5349288c001d-u1",
     "output": {
       "context": [
         "omitted for brevity"
       ],
       "created_at": "2024-05-17T16:56:29.256938735Z",
       "done": true,
       "eval_count": 118,
       "eval_duration": 807433000,
       "load_duration": 3403140284,
       "model": "orca-mini",
       "prompt_eval_count": 46,
       "prompt_eval_duration": 38548000,
       "response": "The sky appears blue because of a process called scattering...",
       "total_duration": 4249684714
     },
     "status": "COMPLETED"
   }
   ```

With your Endpoint set up, you can now integrate it into your application as needed.
